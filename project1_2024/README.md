#Updated version of css circa 2024

It is important to have enough css skills to be able to formulate a strategy
for iteration where each iteration gets closer to a desired pixel perfect
layout

## Places to learn
Youtube videos: they arent structured enough like Josh's material. They are ok
for point topics but they are all similar. They don't have enough depth and the
quality in a youtube video is poor as there are no exercises to practice on.
There also isn't anyone to ask questions. Josh's answers to questions are worth
many times the price of his class.
