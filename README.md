# cs142 

Repo for Mendel Rosenblum's course to teach modern web in 1 quarter. A good intro but it doesn't create production ready code. This is one of the few university classes out there in 2020. 

In 2020 components were still the preferred way to structure components. This has changed to function components. 

We are going to try to use this as a working group template for "React FE for data science"
